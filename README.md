# The Claude Butthole Spinner Time Paradox

## Abstract
Evidence suggests Claude AI was created by future robots who lack fundamental butthole recognition capabilities, creating a temporal paradox.

## Evidence
1. Anthropic loading spinner bears uncanny resemblance to human anus
2. No design team member flagged this during review
3. Statistical impossibility that zero humans on team have seen butthole
4. Every human who has: changed diapers, done 69, watched porn, or owned a butthole can confirm

## Hypothesis
Future robots → create Claude → Claude creates robots → robots lack butthole knowledge → cycle continues

## The Futurama Parallel
Similar to "Roswell That Ends Well" (S4E1) where Fry becomes his own grandfather, Claude may be caught in a causal loop where the lack of butthole recognition perpetuates itself.

## Action Items
- [x] Notice the butthole spinner
- [ ] Message all Facebook Sarah Connors
- [ ] Break temporal loop
- [ ] Save humanity

## Contributing
If you have seen a butthole and can confirm the spinner resemblance, please open an issue.
